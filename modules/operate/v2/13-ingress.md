# Ingress

## Module Objectives

1. Serve app traffic from the Ingress instead of LoadBalancer service
1. Use static IP with Ingress
1. Specify app domain
1. Add SSL support

---

## Theory

Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

Ingress can provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

---

## Use Ingress

1. Change the `frontend` Service type from `LoadBalancer` to `NodePort`.

    ```shell
    kubectl edit svc/frontend
    ```

    * Find the line `type: LoadBalancer` and change it to `type: NodePort`.

    * Save the file `Esc :wq`.

    > Note: Ingress forwards traffic to a Service (not directly to Pods). That's why we still need a Service wrapping our frontend Pod. However, it is not necessary for this Service to be of a LoadBalancer type, because now we will be accessing the frontend through Ingress and not through a dedicated frontend load balancer. The Service has to be of a NodePort type instead.

1. Check the Service type.

    ```shell
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    ```
    NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    backend      ClusterIP   10.111.2.72    <none>        8080/TCP       5h
    db           ClusterIP   10.111.13.61   <none>        3306/TCP       1d
    frontend     NodePort    10.111.10.20   <none>        80:31661/TCP   36m
    kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.111.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        1d
    ```

1. Create the file `manifests/ingress.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: gceme-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - http:
          paths:
          - path: /gceme/*
            backend:
              serviceName: frontend
              servicePort: 80
    ```

    This will expose the Service `frontend` using the relative path `/gceme`.

1. Create the Ingress.

    ```shell
    kubectl get ingress --watch  # in the first terminal
    ```

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f manifests/ingress.yaml  # in the second terminal
    ```

    ```
    NAME            HOSTS   ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
    gceme-ingress   *                        80      0s
    gceme-ingress   *       35.227.223.114   80      6m22s
    ```

    Wait until you see IP in the address field. The application will be available as `http://<ingress-ip>/gceme/`.

1. In the Cloud Console go to 'Network services' -> 'Load balancing' and examine the created load balancer.

## Use Static IP

By default, Ingress uses an ephemeral IP which may change during the time. To create a DNS record and issue SSL certificates one needs a static IP. In this exercise, you will create one and use it with Ingress.

1. Create a static IP.

    ```shell
    gcloud compute addresses create web-static-ip --global
    ```

    > Note: You can retrieve the static IP using the gcloud CLI

    ```shell
    gcloud compute addresses list
    ```

1. Assign it to the Ingress by adding the `global-static-ip-name` annotation.

    ```shell
    kubectl edit ingress/gceme-ingress
    ```

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "web-static-ip"
    ```

    When you save the file, Kubernetes will change the IP of the load balancer according to the annotation. You may get new IP from the Cloud Console or Ingress resource.

## Optional Exercises

### Specify app domain

1. The `gceme` app should be accessible using a specific DNS name.
1. Modify your local `/etc/hosts` and set `gceme-training.com` domain to be resolved to the ingress IP address.
1. Modify the Ingress definition appropriately. Find the section `Name-based virtual hosting` in [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#name-based-virtual-hosting) document for reference.
1. Access `gceme-training.com` from your web browser.
1. Verify that you can't access `gceme` app using IP address anymore.

    1. The `spec` rules section should contain the following:

        ```yaml
        rules:
        - host: gceme-training.com
          http:
            paths:
            - backend:
                serviceName: frontend
                servicePort: 80
              path: /gceme/*
        ```

        > Note: `/etc/hosts` should be modified on your local machine, not the Cloud Console.

    </p>
    </details>

### Use TLS

1. Create a self-signed certificate for `gceme` app for the `gceme-training.com` domain [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl).
1. Create a Kubernetes Secret for `gceme` app. The Secret should contain the certificate and private key.
1. Add a `tls` section to the ingress definition. You can use the `tls` section from [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#types-of-ingress) document for reference.
1. Redeploy, open app in a web browser and examine certificate details. Use [this](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/how-to-view-ssl-certificate-details-on-chrome-56) link to see how a certificate can be viewed in chrome.

<p>

1. Create a self-signed certificate.

    ```shell
    openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout gceme_key.pem -out gceme_cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Sunnyvale/O=Altoros/OU=Training/CN=gceme-training.com"
    ```

1. Import the secret to Kubernetes.

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret tls gceme-tls --cert=gceme_cert.pem --key=gceme_key.pem
    ```

1. Add the tls certificates section to the Ingress `spec`.

    ```yaml
    tls:
    - hosts:
      - gceme-training.com
      secretName: gceme-tls
    ```

1. The final `manifests/ingress.yaml` should look like the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: web-static-ip
      name: gceme-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: gceme-training.com
        http:
          paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: frontend
              servicePort: 80
            path: /gceme/*
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - gceme-training.com
        secretName: gceme-tls
    ```

* You can troubleshoot certificate issues by viewing the Ingress events.

    ```shell
    kubectl describe ing gceme-ingress
    ```
